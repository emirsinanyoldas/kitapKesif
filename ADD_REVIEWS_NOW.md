## 🎯 The Issue: Reviews Not Added Yet

You just need to **add the reviews to your database**. Here's how:

---

## 📋 Prerequisites Check

### Do you have Supabase configured?

**Check your `.env` file:**
- Does it have real values (not `your-project-url-here`)?
- If NO → See "Setup Supabase" below
- If YES → Skip to "Add Reviews" section

---

## 🔧 Setup Supabase (If Needed)

### Quick Method:

1. **Open `.env` file**
2. **Replace** placeholder values with real ones:
   ```env
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxxxxxx.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.xxx
   ```

3. **Get credentials** from: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Settings → API
   - Copy Project URL and anon key

4. **Create database tables:**
   - Go to Supabase → SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL from [`FIX_MODAL_AND_ADD_REVIEWS.md`](./FIX_MODAL_AND_ADD_REVIEWS.md) (Step 2C)

5. **Restart server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop
   npm run dev
   ```
