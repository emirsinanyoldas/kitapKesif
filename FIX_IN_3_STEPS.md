## 📋 Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor (30 seconds)

1. Go to: **https://supabase.com/dashboard**

2. **Log in** with your Supabase account

3. Find and click your **KitapKeşif** project

4. In the left sidebar, click: **SQL Editor**

5. Click the **"New query"** button (top right)

You should now see an empty SQL editor!

---

## 📋 Step 2: Copy & Paste This SQL (30 seconds)

Click the "Copy" button below, then paste into the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Fix books table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can insert books" ON books;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can update books" ON books;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert books"
  ON books FOR INSERT TO public WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can update books"
  ON books FOR UPDATE TO public USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Fix reviews table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can insert reviews" ON reviews;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can update reviews" ON reviews;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert reviews"
  ON reviews FOR INSERT TO public WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can update reviews"
  ON reviews FOR UPDATE TO public USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify it worked
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('books', 'reviews')
ORDER BY tablename, cmd;
```

---

## 📋 Step 3: Run the SQL (10 seconds)

1. Click the **"Run"** button (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)

2. Wait for it to finish (should be instant)

3. Check the results:
   - You should see **6 rows** in the output
   - Should show policies for SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE

---

## ✅ Verify It Worked (30 seconds)

Back in your terminal, run:

```bash
npm run check-db
```

Look for this line:
```
6️⃣  Testing INSERT permissions...
   ✅ INSERT permission working  ← Should say this now!
```

If you see ✅ instead of ❌, **you're done!** 🎉

---

## 🚀 What to Do Next

Now that database is fixed, import 150+ books:

```bash
npm run import-books
```

This will:
- Import 186 books from Open Library
- Add 25+ categories
- Set up cover images
- Take about 3-4 minutes

Then create a backup:

```bash
npm run backup-db
```

And you're all set! 🎊

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see SQL Editor"

**Solution:** Look in the left sidebar under "Database" section. It might be collapsed.

### "Query failed"

**Solution:** Make sure you:
1. Copied ALL the SQL (both books AND reviews sections)
2. Are in the correct project
3. Have admin access to the project

### "Still shows INSERT denied"

**Solution:**
1. Wait 10 seconds
2. Run `npm run check-db` again
3. Check you saw 6 policies in the verification output

6️⃣  Testing INSERT permissions...
   ❌ INSERT permission denied  ← This is the problem
```

### After Fix:
```
6️⃣  Testing INSERT permissions...
   ✅ INSERT permission working  ← Success!
```
