## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Port Numbers May Vary**: If the standard ports (5173, 4173) are in use, the system automatically selects the next available port.

2. **Check Terminal Output**: Always look at the terminal output to see the actual port numbers being used.

3. **Two Different Servers**: 
   - Development server (`npm run dev`) is for active development with hot reload
   - Preview server (`npm run preview`) is for testing the production build

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If the link still doesn't work:

1. **Check if server is running**:
   - Look for the VITE startup message in terminal
   - Make sure there are no error messages

2. **Try a different port**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev -- --port 3000
   ```

3. **Check for conflicting processes**:
   ```bash
   tasklist /fi "imagename eq node.exe"
   ```

4. **Restart the server**:
   - Press Ctrl+C to stop
   - Run the command again

## ✅ Verification

The application should be accessible at one of these URLs:
- Development: http://localhost:5175/
- Preview: http://localhost:4173/

Check your terminal output to confirm the exact port being used.
