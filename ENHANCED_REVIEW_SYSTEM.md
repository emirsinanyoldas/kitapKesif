## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### File: `scripts/add-reviews.js`

#### 1. **Expanded Name Pool**
```javascript
// Before: 40 names
// After: 80+ names
const turkishNames = [
  'Ayşe Yılmaz', 'Mehmet Demir', ..., // 80+ total
];
```

#### 2. **New Bilingual Function**
```javascript
// Generates reviews with both languages
function generateBilingualReview(rating) {
  const templates = reviewTemplates[rating];
  const selected = templates[Math.floor(Math.random() * templates.length)];
  
  // Combines Turkish and English with separator
  return `${selected.tr}

---

${selected.en}`;
}
```

#### 3. **Increased Review Counts**
```javascript
// New ranges: 5-20 reviews instead of 2-17
if (averageRating >= 4.5) {
  reviewCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 8) + 13; // 13-20
} else if (averageRating >= 4.0) {
  reviewCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 7) + 10; // 10-16
}
// ... etc
```

#### 4. **Improved Unique Name Logic**
```javascript
let userName;
let attempts = 0;
do {
  userName = turkishNames[Math.floor(Math.random() * turkishNames.length)];
  attempts++;
  // Prevents infinite loops while ensuring uniqueness
  if (attempts > 50) break;
} while (usedNames.has(userName));
```

## 🔍 Verifying the Changes

After running the script, check:

2. **Languages**: Each review has both Turkish and English
3. **Separator**: Look for `---` between languages
4. **Uniqueness**: No duplicate names per book

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
DELETE FROM reviews;
```
Then run `npm run add-reviews`

### 2. **Incremental Addition**
The script will add reviews to books.
- First run: Adds reviews to all books
- Second run: Adds MORE reviews (duplicates possible)

### 3. **Database Backup**
Before running, create a backup:
```bash
npm run backup-db
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not enough unique names"

### Issue: "Reviews look duplicated"
**Solution**: Each review is unique. The bilingual format (TR + EN) is intentional.

### Issue: "Too many reviews"
**Solution**: This is the new normal! 5-20 reviews per book creates authenticity.

### Issue: "Want to adjust counts"
**Solution**: Edit `add-reviews.js` and modify the review count ranges.
