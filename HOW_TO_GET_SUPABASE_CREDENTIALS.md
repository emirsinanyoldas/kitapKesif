Once your `.env` is configured, you need to set up the database:

The project includes migration files. You need to run them in Supabase:

2. Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
3. Copy the contents of: `supabase/migrations/20251011080112_create_books_and_reviews_schema.sql`
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **"Run"**

### 2. Fix Permissions
```bash
npm run fix-db
```

### 3. Import Books
```bash
npm run import-books
```

### 4. Verify
```bash
npm run check-db
```
