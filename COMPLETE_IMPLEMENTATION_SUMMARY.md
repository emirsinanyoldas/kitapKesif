## 2. 📚 Missing Books Explanation & Solution

### Why Books Disappeared

**Root Cause**: When I fixed your preview issue, I implemented a fallback system:
- **Demo Mode**: Uses Open Library API (temporary books)
- **Full Mode**: Uses Supabase database (permanent books)

Your `.env` file has placeholder credentials, so the app is in Demo Mode. Your original books are still in your Supabase database - they're just not accessible without proper credentials.

### How to Restore Your Books

#### Option 1: Configure Supabase (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Get credentials from https://supabase.com/dashboard
# 2. Update .env file with real values
# 3. Restart server
npm run dev
```

#### Option 2: Re-import Fresh Books

```bash
# 1. Configure Supabase first
# 2. Fix database permissions
npm run fix-db

# 3. Import 150+ books
npm run import-books

# 4. Add bilingual reviews
npm run add-reviews
```
