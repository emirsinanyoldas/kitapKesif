## Debugging Guide

### If Modal Shows But No Information:

**Check console for:**
```
BookModal - Book data: {...}
```

**If book data is empty or has null/undefined fields:**
- This means the issue is with data fetching, not the modal
- Check if Supabase is configured (see previous guides)
- Check if books are being imported correctly

**If console shows error:**
```
BookModal - No book data provided
```
- This means `book` prop is null/undefined
- Issue is in the parent component (App.tsx) or useBookModal hook

### If Categories Don't Show in Filter:

**Check console for:**
```
BookService - Categories extracted: [...]
```

**If categories array is empty:**
- No books loaded yet (still loading)
- Books don't have category field
- Database/API not returning category data

### If Filter Doesn't Work:

**Check:**
1. Is `selectedCategory` prop being passed to SearchBar?
2. Is `setSelectedCategory` function being called?
3. Check browser console for errors
