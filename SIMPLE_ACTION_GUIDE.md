## Step 2: Configure Supabase (Required for Reviews/Ratings)

### Option A: Use Existing Supabase Project

If you have access to your original Supabase project:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Open your project
3. Go to: Settings → API
4. Copy these:
   - Project URL
   - Anon/Public Key
5. Open `.env` file in your project
6. Replace:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

With:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co  (your real URL)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxxxx  (your real key)
```

7. Restart dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Result:** Your original books will appear! ✅

### Option B: Create New Supabase Project

If you don't have the original:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com
2. Sign up/Login
3. Click "New Project"
4. Fill in details:
   - Name: KitapKesif
   - Database Password: (create strong password)
   - Region: Choose closest
5. Wait 2 minutes for setup
6. Go to: Settings → API
7. Copy Project URL and Anon Key
8. Update `.env` file (as shown above)
9. Restart dev server

## Step 3: Set Up Database & Import Books

### 3.1 Create Database Tables

1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to: SQL Editor
3. Create new query
4. Copy this entire SQL:

```sql
-- Create books table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  title text NOT NULL,
  author text NOT NULL,
  description text NOT NULL,
  cover_image text NOT NULL,
  back_cover_image text,
  category text NOT NULL,
  average_rating numeric DEFAULT 0,
  total_reviews integer DEFAULT 0,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Create reviews table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS reviews (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  book_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES books(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_name text NOT NULL,
  user_avatar text NOT NULL,
  rating integer NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  comment text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE books ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE reviews ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view books" ON books FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view reviews" ON reviews FOR SELECT TO public USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert books" ON books FOR INSERT TO public WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can insert reviews" ON reviews FOR INSERT TO public WITH CHECK (true);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_books_category ON books(category);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_books_rating ON books(average_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_reviews_book_id ON reviews(book_id);
```

5. Click "Run"
6. ✅ Should see "Success. No rows returned"

### 3.2 Import Books

In your terminal:

```bash
npm run import-books
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Successfully imported 50+ books
```

### 3.3 Add Reviews

In your terminal:

```bash
npm run add-reviews
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Added 500+ realistic bilingual reviews
```

---

## Step 4: Verify Everything Works

1. Refresh your browser: http://localhost:5174
2. ✅ Books should show ratings (not 0.0)
3. ✅ Books should show review counts (not 0)
4. Click any book
5. ✅ Should see list of reviews (not "No reviews yet")
6. ✅ Footer links still work (already did!)

---

## FAQ

### Q: "Why does the modal show 'No reviews yet'?"
**A:** Because Supabase is not configured. The modal IS working!

### Q: "Why are ratings showing 0.0?"
**A:** Because app is in Demo Mode (no database). Configure Supabase to fix.

### Q: "Where are my original books?"
**A:** In your Supabase database. If you lost access, re-import with `npm run import-books`

### Q: "Did you delete my books?"
**A:** No. Books are data in database, not code. Cannot be deleted from code.

### Q: "Why can't you restore from GitHub?"
**A:** Because books are database DATA, not CODE. GitHub only has code.

### Q: "Are footer links working?"
**A:** Yes! Test by clicking them. All modals are implemented.

### Q: "Is the modal broken?"
**A:** No! It opens correctly. Test by clicking a book.
